Real-Time Number Plate Detection using YOLOv7
Project Overview
This project implements a Real-Time Number Plate Detection System using YOLOv7, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. The system is designed to identify and recognize vehicle license plates from live video streams or images captured by surveillance cameras in urban environments. By leveraging deep learning techniques, this project aims to enhance traffic monitoring, law enforcement, and security systems, with applications in traffic management, toll collection, automated parking systems, and more.

Features

Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine or any server:

Clone the repository: Open your terminal and run:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/Real-Time-Number-Plate-Detection.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Real-Time-Number-Plate-Detection
Set up a Python environment: It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
Install required dependencies: Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install necessary libraries like torch, opencv-python, matplotlib, and others.

Download Pre-trained YOLOv7 Weights: You can use the pre-trained YOLOv7 weights, or you can train your own model (explained later). To download the pre-trained weights:

Go to the official YOLOv7 repository or another trusted source for pre-trained weights.
Place the weights file (e.g., yolov7.pt) in the models/ directory.
Usage
Once the environment is set up, you can use the system for either training the model or detecting license plates in real-time.

Running Real-Time Detection
To use the trained YOLOv7 model to detect number plates in a live video stream or an image, run the detect.py script.

Run detection on a live video stream:

bash
Copy code
python detect.py --source 0  # 0 represents the webcam
Run detection on a video file:

bash
Copy code
python detect.py --source path_to_video_file.mp4
Run detection on an image:

bash
Copy code
python detect.py --source path_to_image.jpg
The model will process the video/image and display the number plate detections in real-time, drawing bounding boxes around detected plates.

Training the Model
If you want to train the model on your own dataset (for example, a new set of license plates), you need to follow these steps:

Prepare the dataset:
Collect and annotate images of vehicles with visible license plates. Use annotation tools like LabelImg to label the bounding boxes around the plates.

Preprocess the data:
Organize the dataset into appropriate folders (train/, test/) and ensure that each image has an associated .txt file containing the bounding box coordinates and class labels.

Configure YOLOv7:

Create a custom dataset configuration file (based on data.yaml).
Update the train.py script to load your custom dataset.
Train the model:
Run the following command to begin training:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --data path_to_data.yaml --cfg yolov7.yaml --weights yolov7.pt --batch-size 16 --epochs 50
This command trains the YOLOv7 model using the pre-trained weights and fine-tunes it for your custom dataset.

Real-Time Detection
After training the model, you can use the detect.py script to run the trained model in real-time for license plate detection:

Run detection on a live video stream (webcam):

bash
Copy code
python detect.py --source 0
Run detection on a video file:

bash
Copy code
python detect.py --source path_to_video.mp4
Run detection on a single image:

bash
Copy code
python detect.py --source path_to_image.jpg
The system will draw bounding boxes around detected license plates and display them in real-time.

Evaluation
To evaluate the model performance, you can use the evaluate.py script, which calculates key metrics such as Precision, Recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision).

Run the following command to evaluate the model on a test dataset:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py --weights path_to_trained_weights.pt --data path_to_data.yaml
